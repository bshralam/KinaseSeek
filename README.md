#KinaseSeek: A Case Study in Virtual Screening for Kinase Inhibitors

1) Objective: This project is a self-directed case study demonstrating a complete structure-based virtual screening workflow to identify potential inhibitors for a specific target.
The goal is to showcase the full process: from target and library selection to docking, post-processing, and hit analysis. The entire workflow is documented in a single Jupyter Notebook.

2) Key Features:
- Target selection and preparation.
- Ligand library preparation.
- Virtual screening.
- Hit analysis and visualisation.

3) Tools Used: Python, RDKit, pandas, Matplotlib, PyMol.
